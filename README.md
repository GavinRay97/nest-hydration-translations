# NestHydration Translations

Translations of the "Nest Hydration" algorithm, originally from:
- https://github.com/CoursePark/NestHydrationJS

But these versions ported from the .NET version located at:
- https://github.com/umbraco/nest-hydration-dotnet

A small change was made to the .NET implementation which allows multiple (compound) primary keys.

Currently, translations exist for:
- TypeScript
- Java
- Kotlin
- Python
- Haskell

These were done with the help of OpenAI Codex, manually cleaned up.
